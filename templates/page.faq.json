In the event that there are any shipping issues, we will do our best to help, but it is the customer's responsibility to be present when the shipment is delivered. We suggest looking through your property's communal spaces and contacting your neighbors if you cannot find an item that is marked as delivered. We do not issue reimbursements for lost or stolen parcels after the courier marks the delivery as delivered. Any packages with tracking numbers that are marked as \"undelivered\" are still covered by our delivery promise, and we will work with the customer to find a solution.<\/p><p>Changing your address after placing order: Customers agree that Formuland is in charge of delivering to the address they supply when placing an order. Our customer support staff will make an effort to accommodate changes of address after your item has been paid for, but we cannot guarantee a new delivery address. Any failed deliveries caused by a shipment being delivered to the wrong address are not considered refundable. Formuland is not responsible for misdelivered goods once they have left our warehouse in the case that the change of address was not handled by a delivery service in time for the delivery to be redirected. Requests for mail redirection should be avoided because, despite our carriers' best efforts, there is a good chance that the old address will still be used.<\/p><p>Delivery Delay: Despite our shipping partners' best efforts, delays that are out of our control occasionally may prevent packages from being delivered within 1-6 business days. Even though these mishaps are exceedingly uncommon, we suggest customers to give themselves up to 3 weeks for delivery during the busiest holiday seasons. Because not all shipping companies are open on weekends, we do not count Saturdays or Sundays when calculating a 1-6 business day delivery window. Delivery delays caused by the carrier, including any caused by import and customs clearance, are not deemed refundable because they are outside Formuland's control. Formuland has committed to its customers that it will ship out orders within a 24-hour window at the most.<\/p>"

Most significantly, you may rest easy knowing that these burnt milk particles have no negative health repercussions.<br\/><br\/>Additionally, we can confidently state that what you observe is not mold due to the sanitary production of formula at the manufacturers and the repeated analysis of the product for any kind of contamination.
